Secrets of Data Structure and Algorithms - Newton School

## Why should you learn DSA?
- Skillset
- Get into product-based companies.
- better career growth
- Better Pay
- Bigger Challenges to solve.

```
You develop a problem-solving mindset.
```
```
You Develop a challenging & a good mindset. This helps you to be determinant to solve the problem in front of you.
```

```**Don't be discouraged and be frustated at the beginning.**```   <br>
```**Don't be afraid of the mathematical part.**```

For mathematical part You have to know: 
- Basic maths
- Basic Analytical Knowledge.
- Be patient

<br>

## What is DSA?
* You have given a problem, and you have to solve it in the <b>Most Best Possible Way</b>.
* How would you <b>efficiently</b> play with the data?
* How would you efficiently solve any problem?


## How to start DSA?
- Learn a programming language first. (Java / C++)
  - Because, you have the knowledge of a programming language to express your thought-process into code. 
- Start with basic data structure questions.
    - Try to solve as much as these problems you can solve in the starting.
    - Don't skip these basic problems like other fools.
- Learn basic algorithm concepts.
    - Learn basic algorithm questions.

##  Platforms to Practice DSA:
```
1. Leetcode
2. HackerRank
3. CodeChef
4. Spoj
```

- You can also enroll yourself in some coding bootcamps.
    - Learn fullstack, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Android.
    - You get practical knowledge of the industry. Which you don't get in the college.
    - With the help of these bootcamp companies like Newton School, you can get placed into companies like Zomato and Rapido.

## For Interviews
- Problem Solving
- DSA
- Specific Technologies
    - ```Startups don't have time to teach you the technology. So, sometime they prefer that you already know these technologies like ReactJS, etc...```

## Questions Time...

```
Problem Solving is Necessary! For Sure! ---- Also for your life.
```

---
Is Python Required?
```
 It is preferred for Machine Learning, AI, Data Science Jobs.
```
---

How much time is required for DSA per day?

```
If you're working --- 2 to 3 Hours per day.
```
---

How many days required to master DSA?

```
It all depends on your commitment, knowledge, etc...
You may require 5 month, while it may be 8 months for someone else...
```
---

```
HackerRank is good for beginners
```
---

```
Internships are important, you should target them.
```
---

Should you stop learning DSA after sometime, example 1 year?
```
No, you must keep learning more & more..... continuously
```
---

What Google prefers more?

```
Google Demands Problem-Solving more..... in Interviews..... for freshers....
```
---
How much JavaScript is required for learning framewormk

```
Learn the Code JavaScript first & then you can move to ReactJs like frameworks.
```
